# PageRank
A PageRank algorithm implementation that evaluates the importance of web pages based on both the number and quality of incoming links. The project includes a program that parses a corpus of web pages, constructs a Markov chain model representing the web, and utilizes the PageRank algorithm to calculate the relative importance of each page.
